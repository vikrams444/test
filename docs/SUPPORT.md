## Where to get help

If you think you've found a bug in the Online Tools, please [check the existing issues](https://github.com/virams444/tools/issues), and if no one has reported the problem, [open a new issue](https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight/issues/new).

If you have a general question about the theme, how to implement it, or how to customize it for your site you have two options:

1. Search for your query on [`support.github.com`](https://support.github.com/?q=pages+tools), which will also look for similar topics on [`github.community`](https://github.community/search?q=pages+tools)
2. Ask your question of the Jekyll community on [talk.jekyllrb.com](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/)
